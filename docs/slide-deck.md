### ⭐ Problem Statement — Why This Matters
- endless back-and-forth with invitees, 
- time zone confusion, 
- double-bookings, and 
- misaligned facility calendars.

**The Traditional Approach:**
- 🐌 **Slow**: Checking 10 attendees sequentially takes 10+ seconds
- 🤕 **Error-prone**: Manual timezone conversions, missed conflicts
- 😓 **Tedious**: Juggling multiple tools (Calendar, Email, Room booking, Policy docs)
- 💸 **Costly**: ~100 hours/year wasted on scheduling for a mid-sized company

- **Cost Structure:** Per-user licensing models create unsustainable expenses at scale
- **Integration Constraints:** Limited compatibility with proprietary or legacy email systems
- **Facility Management:** Absence of resource booking capabilities (conference rooms, equipment)
- **Workflow Integration:** Cannot be embedded into existing enterprise automation pipelines
- **Access Control:** Insufficient support for internal-external collaboration workflows
